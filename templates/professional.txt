Subject: GenAI Intern @ Motilal Oswal - Interested in AI/ML Roles at {{ company }}

Hi {{ recruiter_name.split()[0] }},

I'm a final-year CS student at Bennett University with 6+ months experience as a GenAI Intern at Motilal Oswal, where I built production RAG systems and multi-agent architectures using LangChain and Claude. I'm interested in AI/ML opportunities at {{ company }} because of my focus on building practical AI solutions.

How can I start the interview process?

Best,
Ansh Agrawal
